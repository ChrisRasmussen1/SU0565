Storage Migration Service
-------------------------

>   You are to make sure that one virtual member server is running as a file
>   server with shares, permissions and files. Configure another member server
>   as both destination and orchestrator server. Run everything through Windows
>   Admin Center. Test after migration that permissions on shares and file
>   system is correct on destination server.
