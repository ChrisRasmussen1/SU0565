Storage Spaces Direct (S2D)

>   You are to configure S2D on at least two virtual Server 2019 servers (not
>   the DC’s). Use the server SVR1 and SVR2 as some of the servers - SVR3 as an
>   additional. Remember that SVR3 needs domain membership - and both SVR1 and
>   SVR2 needs additional disks.

>   When done – do **not** revert virtual machines to Checkpoint.
