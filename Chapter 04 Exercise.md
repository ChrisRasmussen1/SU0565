Results: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully deployed
and configured an enterprise subordinate CA. You also should have a subordinate
CA certificate issued by a root CA installed on CA2. To establish trust between
the root CA and domain member clients, you have verified that you can use Group
Policy to deploy a root CA certificate.
